# STYLE JOURNEYS WITH Валерия Косенкова (Valeria Kosenkova)

## Precious Treasures: Feel, Create, Enjoy.

Every city has **its** own authentic style.

I am a hedonism guide: in every trip I'm looking for treasures - people, places, events. I choose the rarest and the most stylish ones.

Travelling with me, you'll be feeling every minute and every step, enjoying flavours, tastes and colors of the city.

(But you don't tick places you visit)

The trip includes three directions:

* Style (local brands, masters, boutiques, antique markets, book and design shops),
* Art (architecture, theatres, opera, cinema festivals, museums)
* and the rest (restaurants, jazz bars, SPA, golf).

We'll walk through the places reflecting the mood and the character of the city.

As a professional personal stylist, I'm capable of helping you to find something special, that reflects the style of the city, pass it through your feelings and add it to your personal style.

One may be inspired by the generosity of Vienna, sensuality of Paris, splendor of Rome, modesty of St-Petersburg, convenience of Zurich, irony of London, creativity of Berlin, magic of Istanbul...

Places we meet are not popular tourist's trails, but precious treasures. Treasures, that will help you to open the treasure of your heart.

# STYLE JOURNEYS WITH Валерия Косенкова (Valeria Kosenkova)

## Precious Treasures: Feel, Create, Enjoy.

Every city has ~~his~~ **its** own authentic style.

I am ~~guide hedonist~~ a hedonism guide: in every trip I'm looking for treasures - people, places, events. I choose the rarest and the most stylish ones.

Travelling with me, you'll be feeling every minute and every step, enjoying flavours, tastes and colors of the city.

(But you don't tick places you visit)

The trip include**s** three directions:

* ~~the~~ Style (local brands, masters, boutiques, antique markets, book and design shops),
* ~~the~~ Art (architecture, theatres, opera, cinema festivals, museums)
* and the Rest (restaurants, jazz bars, SPA, golf).

We'll walk through the places reflecting the mood and the character of the city.

As a professional personal stylist, I'm capable of helping you to find something special, that reflect**s** the style of the city, pass it throug**h** your feelings and add it to your personal style.

One may **be** inspire*d* *by* the generosity ~~in~~ **of** Vienna, sensuality ~~in~~ **of** Paris, splendor ~~in~~ **of** Rome, modesty ~~in~~ **of** **St-**Petersburg, convenience ~~in~~ **of** Zurich, irony ~~on~~ **of** London, creativity ~~in~~ **of** Berlin, magic ~~in~~ **of** Istanbul...

Places we meet are not popular tourist's trails, but precious treasures. Treasures, that **will** help you **to** open the treasure in your heart.
